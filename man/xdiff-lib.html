The <b>LibXDiff</b> library implements basic and yet complete
functionalities to create file differences/patches to both binary and
text files. The library uses memory files as file abstraction to achieve
both performance and portability. For binary files, <b>LibXDiff</b>
implements (with some modification) the algorithm described in <i>File
System Support for Delta Compression</i> by <i>Joshua P. MacDonald</i>, 
while for text files it follows directives described in <i>An O(ND)
Difference Algorithm and Its Variations</i> by <i>Eugene W. Myers</i>.
Memory files used by the library are basically a collection of buffers
that store the file content. There are two different requirements for
memory files when passed to diff/patch functions. Text files for
diff/patch functions require that a single line do not have to spawn
across two different memory file blocks. Binary diff/patch functions
require memory files to be compact. A compact memory files is a file
whose content is stored inside a single block. Functionalities inside
the library are available to satisfy these rules. Using the <b>XDL_MMF_ATOMIC</b>
memory file flag it is possible to make writes to not split the written
record across different blocks, while the functions <b>xdl_mmfile_iscompact</b>()
, <b>xdl_mmfile_compact</b>() and <b>xdl_mmfile_writeallocate</b>()
are usefull to test if the file is compact and to create a compacted
version of the file itself. The text file differential output uses the
raw unified output format, by omitting the file header since the result
is always relative to a single compare operation (between two files).
The output format of the binary patch file is proprietary (and binary)
and it is basically a collection of copy and insert commands, like
described inside the MacDonald paper. The library is compatible with
almost every Unix implementation (configure script) and it is also
compatible with Windows through custom (nmake) make files.<br>
